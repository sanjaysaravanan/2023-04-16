Topics:
  Light / Dark Mode for application - refer axios-formik repo
    Implementtation:
      use a context with values ( light / dark )
    
    Based on the context value switch the css classname/values

Why we are gonna use redux:

  What is Props Drilling:
    passing state/props values to multiple children compoenent

  When to use useReducer:
    when a component has multiple state handling, go for useReducer with single initialState

    Eg: implment calculator using useReducer

  context:
    when large state values is required for complete component tree ( entire application ) using Context.Provider

  Lot of re-renders


Redux:

  Large Applications uses Redux to Manage the 
    State, Actions, Data as a whole

  Example:
    Assume Gmail Application ( Doesn't Mean Gamil use Redux ) 
    uses a lot of components
      1. User ( mailid )
      2. Compose ( Subject, To, CC, BCC )
      3. Drafts ( Mail which is unfinished ) --> Drafts Count Increases
      4. Categories, Junk, Starred, Important, Chats.
    
    Also, Jira Board

    Above entities/features of application uses different types of Desgin, Interactions, States from minor/small frontend actions

    This case managing the state/data only with basic state( state, reducer, context) on inidividual components and passing the data to the required components is very difficult

    May lead to props drilling or more num of callbacks/re-renders

  So, should we use redux everywhere or not
    ans: this depends on Your requirements

  Concept to Understand Redux:
    Think a Online Order scenario,

      what are all the end-to-end steps in an online order

      1. Order - Delivery Date 
      2. Collect the Order items from Seller( Store )
      3. Package and Delivery Initiataion
      4. Dispatched 
      5. Reaches desitnation and delivered
      6. Check the prod and use it is Good

  useReducer ( Redux like hook which help understanding redux )

  Redux:
    External library for state management using different reducers

    Install the package with ---> npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
    react-redux
    Chrome-Extension - redux-devtools

    1. Store Setup with initial State and reducers - Done
      manipulation of the store 
    2. Actions ()
    3. Reducers ()
    4. Consume the store values
      hook in react-redux called as useSelector
